                            <p>2. Javascript can only be run in the browsers..</p>
                            <p>3. It is basically used on the client-side.</p>
                            <p>5. Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox. </p>
                            <p>5. 	Some of the javascript frameworks are RamdaJS, TypedJS, etc. </p>

                        <h3>What is JWT?</h3>
                        <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share information between two parties securely â€” a client and a server. In most cases, it's an encoded JSON containing a set of claims and a signature. It's usually used in the context of other authentication mechanisms like OAuth, OpenID to share user-related information. It's also a popular way to authenticate/authorize users in a microservice architecture.</p>
                        <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                        <p>1. A user logs in to an application with a username and password, or otherwise proves her identity.</p>
                        <p>2. The server confirms her identity and sends back an access token containing a reference to her identity.</p>
                        <p>3. The client then includes this access token with every request to the server.</p>
                        <p>4. For protected routes, REST API authentication middleware asserts the presence of a valid access token. The server can further use the identity asserted by the validated token to implement more granular permissions, such as acting on resources belonging to that particular user.</p>
